Create spotify account

Delete the "spotify:playlist:" part of the pasted URI and only keep the alphanumeric pin.

Step 6: 
Launch Python Jupyter notebook. Make sure to download spotipy (given in code) and pandas libraries.

Copy paste the code provided into your Jupyter environment and enjoy! Make sure to pay attention to indentations!

Step 8:
The final data will be exported to a .csv. If you are unable to find it, just type in the csv's name in your computer's search bar and the location will appear.
